              <article>
                <p>First of all I am an engineer. I love to solve problems. I spend most of my
                  personal time reading about new technologies, new languages and new techniques.
                  Even if I would never use them directly, they usually inspire me to invent
                  something new. I love my work and I am very passionate about technology. I like to
                  share my experience and learn through my colleagues and the
                  technical community.</p>

                <p>The main technology I use nowadays is Javascript. I started to program in
                  Javascript in 2006 and since then worked full time with it. I did front-end work
                  for all my projects, as well as back-end. During past 6 years I built my own
                  universal and light core (PHP/Zend + Javascript/PrototypeJS) to make new projects
                  faster and easier. It is still used in many projects and
                  couple of different teams.</p>

                <p>
                  Past 3-4 years I read a lot about NodeJS and always tried to do something with it.
                  But only since the end of 2012 I started to use NodeJS in some of my real projects
                  - at last it became mature enough and I got chance to use it for production.
                  Based on Node, I created zend-like dispatching library

                <h3>Zend-based Core</h3>

                <p class="subDetails noPrint">
                  <a id="showZend" href="javascript:show('Zend')"><span
                    class="icon-chevron-right"></span> Expand</a>
                  <a id="hideZend" href="javascript:hide('Zend')" style="display: none;"><span
                    class="icon-chevron-down"></span> Collapse</a>
                </p>

                <div id="containerZend" class="print" style="display: none;">

                  <p>Mentioned in summary Zend-based core was started during my work at Cybertone.
                    Today I support and develop one project based on it. I wanted to publish full
                    source code, but 3-4 years ago it was not good enough to be shared, and now it
                    looks a bit outdated in matter of used frameworks (Zend Framework 1.12.0,
                    Prototype JS 1.7.1).</p>

                  <p>I support "thin controller" idea and main business logic is implemented in
                    models. Every model consists of Db layer, Entity transfer object, Db and Form
                    data adapters and Manager that makes all the main work. In Db layer
                    Zend_Db_Adapter is used and for all data selects I use Zend_Db_Select. I do not
                    use Zend_Db_Table/Row, instead Entities are used. Entity is just a simple
                    transfer object, usually represents table row, but also has some additional
                    properties and provides fluent interface to access related Entities.</p>

                  <p>The way it works is pretty simple and I managed to introduce it in at least two
                    teams in very short time. It is also project-independent and could be used in
                    any existing Zend-based project.</p>

                  <p>Recently I made important upgrade of back-end part of Core. Now it successfully
                    utilizes Redis and NodeJS to have event-based (with Redis pub/sub)
                    communications among different entities. The project is still based on
                    PHP/Zend/Mysql but some heavy work (like counters, caching, cascaded updates) is
                    now done with Node and Redis (and sometimes PHP callbacks made by Node). The
                    way
                    it works is pretty interesting and I will be happy to share it.</p>

                  <p>The way my front-end Javascript part is organized is still fresh despite of its
                    age (I found some new popular libraries having similar architecture and flow).
                    It consists of main component loader, couple of additional support classes (like
                    request manager) and a lot of completely independent components. AMD ideology is
                    used there to load everything (local and remote css and
                    js).
                    Actually, I implemented the loader, that works in very similar way to very
                    popular RequireJS library. First version was written about 6 years ago and that
                    time we did not have such a big variety of good and simple libs. Even jQuery was
                    pretty bad comparing to PrototypeJS that time.</p>

                  <p>All components communicate using native DOM events only, therefore it is very
                    easy to add new components, load them dynamically and communicate with others.
                    In addition to pure front-end components, there are plenty of components, that
                    work together with my custom Zend Form Elements.</p>

                  <p>I can say that even being the part of my core, it still could be used outside
                    of it - once I took some main JS core files and components and easily integrated
                    them with a Magento project (it uses Prototype).</p>

                  <p>For all my new projects I, of course, use all these new libraries (like
                    RequireJS, Underscore, jQuery, Async, and many more), still keeping similar way
                    and architecture, just using different libraries.</p>

                <h3>NodeJS Puma library</h3>

                <p class="subDetails noPrint">
                  <a id="showPuma" href="javascript:show('Puma')"><span

                </p>

                <div id="containerPuma" class="print" style="display: none;">

                  <p>This library supposed to be used in ExpressJS based projects, and mainly
                    oriented on former Zend Framework developers. It has similar dispatching and
                    routing processes, uses controllers. Does not have any views and models section,
                    because I wanted to keep it as small as possible. It allows to build modular API
                    services and has bootstrapping middle-ware to serve static
                    contend for one-page applications.</p>

                  <p>There is a JSDoc generated documentation, that covers all publicly available
                    methods with relevant usage examples. </p>

                  <p>I develop and support it in my spare time and plan to use for my future
                    personal projects.</p>

                <h3>NodeJS Gleam library</h3>

                <p class="subDetails noPrint">
                  <a id="showGleam" href="javascript:show('Gleam')"><span
                    class="icon-chevron-right"></span> Expand</a>
                  <a id="hideGleam" href="javascript:hide('Gleam')" style="display: none;"><span
                    class="icon-chevron-down"></span> Collapse</a>
                </p>

                <div id="containerGleam" class="print" style="display: none;">
                  <p>Besides Puma, there is another library available - Gleam. And it is much more
                    interesting and exiting. I like the idea of Transfer Objects within application.
                    In my applications I use Entities (simple TO but with some additional functions
                    like data validation, type casting, etc). Because I planned to write modern
                    one-page-apps I decided to have Entities on the front-end as
                    well.</p>

                  <p>That is how the idea of Gleam was born. And now I am able to write Entity once
                    and use it on the NodeJS side and on the browser side. Every entity is
                    automatically serialized to JSON and de-serialized on front-end to correct
                    objects. Gleam is for now on the very early stage, it is more like "proof of
                    concept". I still need to build some real projects based on it.</p>

                  project was frozen
                  (business reason) and new version was not deployed.

              <h3>Software engineer at Cybertone</h3>

              <p class="subDetails">October 2007 &mdash; October 2010</p>

              <p>I was responsible for internal CMS based on Zend Framework. 3rd major revision was
                completely overwritten by me "from scratch". Also I made custom JS framework, based
                on Prototype and Scriptaculous.

                There were more than 30 projects I've done partially or completely by myself:
                <a href="http://djmag.com.au" class="noPrint" target="_blank">DJMag Ukraine <span
                  class="icon-share-alt icon-small"></span></a><span class="print"
                  style="display: none;">http://djmag.com.au</span>,

                  style="display: none;">http://sharmanka.ua</span>.

                Almost all of them were based on my Zend Core. But some small projects I've
                developed using only clean Zend Framework:
                <a href="http://myme.ru" class="noPrint" target="_blank">MyMe <span
                  class="icon-share-alt icon-small"></span></a><span class="print"

                  style="display: none;">http://cybertone.eu</span>.
              </p>

              <p>There were not only content-oriented sites but also some e-commerce sites and
                startups.</p>

              <p>I was fully responsible for all front-end development tasks (html, css, javascript)
                and CMS core evolution.</p>
